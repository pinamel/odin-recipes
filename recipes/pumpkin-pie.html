            The one and only pumpkin pie recipe! Proof that a good recipe doesn't necessarily need to be a complicated one — you 
            get a great result with canned pumpkin puree and store-bought pie crust. Of course, you can customize it to suit 
            your preferences by using fresh pumpkin or a homemade pie crust for that from-scratch taste.
